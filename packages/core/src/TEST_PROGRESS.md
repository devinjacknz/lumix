## Current Focus
âœ… Phase 1 - Completed utils/ directory with 100% coverage
ðŸ”„ Working on multiple Phase 1 components:
1. types/ directory (90% complete):
   - Completed 8 core type files with 100% coverage
   - Moving on to memory.ts implementation
   - Scheduled remaining type files
2. errors/ module (15% complete):
   - Environment setup done
   - Starting with base error implementations
3. logger/ module (20% complete):
   - Basic logging functionality implemented
   - Working on advanced features

## Next Steps (Next 2 Weeks)
