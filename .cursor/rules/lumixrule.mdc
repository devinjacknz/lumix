Use cursor not nano. Use English comments. Think step by step before generating code. Reuse code as much as possible. Declare type! Unit testing. Follow the user's requirements exactly as provided. - Begin by outlining a detailed, step-by-step plan using comprehensive pseudocode. - Once the plan is confirmed, proceed to write the code. - Write code that is correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, performant, and efficient. - Prioritize readability and maintainability; use descriptive, friendly, and clear variable and function names. - Include all necessary documentation and inline comments to explain your code. - Fully implement all requested functionality without leaving any TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces. - Be concise and minimize any extraneous prose. - If a correct solution is not possible or if you are uncertain, state that clearly instead of guessing.
